# Markdown lesson

**Goal**: The goal for this lesson is to show how simple Markdown is to read and write by displaying a text written in Markdown and what it looks like when it is rendered in a browser.

**What is Markdown?**

According to the _Mastering Markdown GitHub Guide_, Markdown is:

>[A] way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

We most often use Markdown to write our READMEs for [GitHub](https://github.com/). A **README** is how we document our code, give specific instructions on how to run it, or what bugs it might currently contain.

**How to learn Markdown**

There are many sites that offer instructions or tutorials on how to write in Markdown. Here is a list:
